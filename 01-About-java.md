### What is Java?

It is an object oriented language similar to C++, but with advanced & simplified features

The java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords
1. Simple 
2. object oriented
3. distributed
4. Multithreaded
5. Dynamic
6. Architecture neutral
7. Portable
8. High Performance
9. Robust
10. Secure


### Why java is Simple, Object Oriented?

Java is Simple because it's syntax is based on C++. In java there is no need to remove unreferenced object due to Automatic Garbage Collection feature 

Java is based on OOmethodology. Everything in java revolves around object. A java application is made of many objects of different type which act as medium between data & behavior.


### Why java is platform independent?

when you write program in java and when you compile it, a separate file is created for the program, this .class file is known as byte code of java.

The byte code generated in windows OS can be executed easily and efficiently in the UNIX OS with the help of JVM present in UNIX. Thus JVM is platform dependent as it differes in windows & unix but the byte code in .class file generated from java program is platform independent as it runs and generates the same output when ran on different operating systems like windows & UNIX.


### Why java is robust & secure?

1. The meaning of robust is strong. java is robust because there is no concept of pointers in java which causes security issues.

2. java has strong memory management. also java has automatic garbage collection which run on JVM

3. java uses it's own virtual runtime environment unlike c, c++ which uses OS runtime environment.

4. also there is type checking & exception handling mechanism features in java.


### Why java is multi-threaded & Dynamic?

1. A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. the main advantage of multithreding is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. it share a common memory area. threads are important for multimedia, web applications etc.

2. java is dynamic language it supports dynamic loading of classes it means classes are loaded on demand.


### Why java is high performance & distributed?

1. java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (C++) java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, eg. c, c++ etc.

2. java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in java. RMI & EJB are used for creating distributed applications.


### Why java is architecture neutral and portable

1. java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed

2. in c prgramming language, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture & 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. however, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 & 64-bit architectures in java.

3. java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the java bytecode to any platform. it doesn't require any implemementation.
